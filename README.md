# Module-11-Challenge

# Part 1 Instructions
To start, open up the starter code folder named part_1_mars_news.ipynb. You will be working through this code to scrape the Mars News Website.

You will start coding by creatind a Beutiful Soup object and extract text elements from the website. You will need to extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped, and store the results in Python data structures.

After that is done, export the scraped data to a JSON file.

# Part 2 Instructions
To start, open up the starter code folder named part_2_mars_weather.ipynb. You will be using automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.

Create a Beutiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.

After that is done, you will need to assemble the data into a Pandas DataFrame. Make sure the columns have the same headings as the table on the website and that column is associated with the correct data type.

Next, you will complete an analysis to find how many months exist on Mars, the coldest and warmest months, the months with the least and most atmospheric pressure on Mars, and how many Earth days exist in a Martian Year.

Once the analysis is complete, export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
